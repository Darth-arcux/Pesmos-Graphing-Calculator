##This file is important and will be updated throughout the full development cycle of Pesmos.##

NOTE: This is the pre-alpha release of Pesmos, a multi-dimensional function grapher, so some bugs may be present. Report them to the dev to make sure they are fixed. 


Utilisation: 

(1.) Use sqrt() or '**0.5'  to apply square roots and likewise for cubic roots or such. 
(2.) Enter the function into the application before you switch modes (i.e. dimensions). 
(3.) Notify the dev if you find any other quirks than what is provided here.


Planned updates:

For now, just bug fixing, adding icons to some places (like the Taskbar icon) and adding an interactable keyboard to make adding various stuff like sqrt easier. 


FEATURES:

- 2D plots of single or multiple functions y = f(x, t).
- 3D surface plots z = f(x, y, t).
- Safe parsing of user expressions with SymPy’s lambdify backed by NumPy.
- Derivatives, definite integrals, and root finding in 2D.
- Real-time animation slider for parameterized functions.
- CSV import/export and figure saving.
- Theme switcher (default/clam) and toggleable grid/axes.
- Robust error handling and “safe” array sanitization.

#P.S. Don't try and steal the application because it already has my name embedded in it.#
